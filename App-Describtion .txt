App describtion: this simple app will perform the simple task of allowing to enter information relevant to the health of your favorite dog, including 
weight and height. Why weight and height you may ask. Well it's the best and most common way to accuratly monitor our favorite fur friend health.
This simple and comonly use health monitaring technique is use by vets and dog specialist alike to get a describtive idea of the overhall health of
a dog. Idealy I was hoping to attach a database that will allow the user to compare his or her dog weight and height by comparing to healthy dog
of the same breed but this first step is a start toward that goal. The app also allow you to keep the data you've enter and save it in a list in 
order to keep good record and hopfully start a database that could be utilze in any pet monitaring service.
